# Requesting new features in Datahub

```{note}
Do you have suggestions on new ways to improve our offering? If yes, read below!

```

* How do I raise a new requirement for the hub?

Raise a new github issue using this [link](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=featurerequest.md)

Follow the steps outlined as part of the template to make the case for this enhancement

* Where will I get updates/notifications about the Datahub feature releases?

We are trying to build a cadence by which we send public announcements about feature releases or version upgrades. Do watch out for emails from datahub-announce list going forward!
 
* How can I collaborate with other users on a notebook at the same time?

Currently, We don't provide options to collaborate with other users using any of our hubs. However, we are working towards integrating collaborative computing experience through Jupyterhub's Retrolab functionality

* How can I contribute to the open source community building this tool?

Reach out to us if you want to contribute and be part of this community. You can get a sense of how to contribute to Datahub by reading this [link] (https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/admins/pre-reqs.html)
