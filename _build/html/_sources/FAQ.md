# Frequently Asked Questions

```{tabbed} Onboarding new users to the Hub:
1. What are the varied resources that I can review to onboard myself?

If you are new to Datahub and are interested to know more about the technical features of Datahub, you can refer to the documentation available https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/

2. What programming languages are supported by the hub?
Datahub primarily supports three languages - Python, R and Julia. However, we also can support other languages as and when required. Do raise an github issue or send us an email to xxx to share your exact requirement.

3. How many hubs across the campus exist? Which courses use them extensively?
Currently, We have 15+ hubs that caters to the diverse needs of our campus audience. This includes Datahub which is has the maximum number of courses using it for their specific needs. We have Data 8, Data 100 hub, Biology hub etc.. serving teaching team and students enrolled as part of Data 8, Data 100 and Biology department respectively.

4. What is the default Memory/CPU requirement for every hub?
By default our hubs offer 1 GB RAM. However, if your class/research requires more complex computation then please do reach out to us.

5. What criteria determine the memory allocated to each user in a specific hub?

6. What are the packages pre-installed for every hub?

7. What is the process to raise Github issues? How can I track the raised issues?
If you want to raise a bug currently, you can use this link (https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new/choose). 

8. When do I receive a response when an issue gets raised?
We currently don't have any kind of SLA but as a rule of thumb we try to respond to your queries within 1-2 days tie

9. Are there existing templates for submitting requests to the infrastructure team?
There are multiple templates available which are summarized below,
i) Issue Tracker: If you found a bug in the workflow and want to raise an issue for the same, then please do use this template to raise an issue
ii) New Enhancement: If you found a new feature/documentation that would help you with the existing workflow then please do use this template to raise an issue
iii) Package Addition/Change request: If you want to install new packages in R/Python/Julia as part of your hub then please do raise a request using this template
iv) Request for RAM: If you want to increase/decrease RAM for your specific hub then please do use this template to request

10. As an instructor, What is the process to create a hub for teaching a course?
We would like to know the exact use case for creating a hub. We generally recommend using the Datahub for teaching purposes if it is a small class size or the computational requirements for your courses/research is not complex.
```

```{tabbed} Changing existing requirements:
1. What should I do if I want to increase the RAM size in my hub?
Raise an issue using the template here!
2. What should I do if I need more CPU power as part of my hub?
Raise an issue using the template here!
3. What should I do if I want to install more packages? 
Raise an issue using the template here!
4. As an instructor, What should I do if I want to conduct a workshop? Are there any existing hubs that I could repurpose?
Send us an email to this email id with the specific usecase you have in mind. 
We would like to know i) your usecase ii) memory requirement iii) CPU requirement iv) size of the class/user base v) Dataset size vi) Language required
5. As a researcher, What is the process to request a hub focused on research?
Send us an email to this email id with the specific usecase you have in mind. 

6. I am going to run a large dataset for my class. What are the steps I can take to ensure that the hub has the required compute power?
As a rule of thumb, we would recommend following steps.
If these steps are not helpful then we would recommend reaching out to us separaetly

7. What should I do If I want to switch from an existing hub to an R hub?
Send us an email here
8. As an instructor, Can I request a custom image with different installation requirements?
We need to know your usecase better
