# Onboarding new users to the Hub

```{note}
Are you new to Datahub? Do you want to learn more about the services offered by the hub? If yes, Do refer below!

```

**What are the varied resources that I can review to onboard myself?**

If you are new to Datahub and are interested to learn more about the configuration used by various Berkeley hubs, you can refer to this [resource](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/). If you want to set up a hub infrastructure at your end and are interested to learn more about the technical details then use this [resource](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**What languages are supported by the hub?**

Datahub primarily supports three languages - **Python, R and, Julia**. However, We can also support other languages on a case-to-case basis. If you have a unique requirement for the hub, Please share your exact requirement over an email to ds-infrastructure@lists.berkeley.edu to raise a Github [issue](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new/choose).

**How many hubs across the campus exist? Which courses use them extensively?**

Currently, We have 15+ hubs that cater to the diverse needs of the campus audience. This includes the main Datahub, which supports multiple courses/departments. In addition, We have separate hubs for Data 8, Data 100, Biology etc. serving the needs of the teaching team and enrolled students. You can learn more about the varied hubs deployed through this [link](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/users/hubs.html)

**What is the default Memory/CPU requirement for every hub?**

Our default hub Datahub has 1 GB of RAM. However, if your course/research has more complex computation requiring increased RAM, please reach out to us.

**What are the different services offered as part of the Datahub?**

You can learn more about the varied services offered through  this jupyterhubs [documentation](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/users/services.html)

**What are the packages pre-installed for every hub?**

Package requirement varies across the different hubs. We ensure that basic python packages such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc., are installed across all the Jupyter hubs. Our R hubs also support shiny, dplyr, tidyR, RSQLlite, etc. However, you can customize the packages for the hubs by requesting them using this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=datahub-package-addition---change-request.md&title=Request+python+package+X+for+class+Y)

**What is the process to raise Github issues? How can I track the raised issues?**

If you want to raise a bug, you can use this [link](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new/choose) to submit your issues. You can also use post messages to our [Piazza channel](https://piazza.com/class/ksqmnrrhvcl11f) to raise further queries!

**When do I receive a response when an issue gets raised?**

We currently donâ€™t have any SLA with regard to varied requests from users. However, we try to respond to your queries within 1-2 days as a rule of thumb. In the upcoming months, we will also define an SLA for basic requests such as package requests, admin access, etc.

**Are there existing templates for submitting requests to the infrastructure team?**

There are multiple templates available which are summarized below,

**Issue Tracker:** If you found a bug in the workflow and want to raise an issue for the same, then please do use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) to raise an issue.

**New Enhancement:** If you envision a new feature/documentation that would help your existing workflow, then please do use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=featurerequest.md) to submit a feature request.

**Package Addition/Change request:** If you want to install new packages in R/Python/Julia as part of your hub then please do raise a request using this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=higher-resources.md&title=Request+more+RAM+for+class+X) to make the package requests.

**Request for RAM:** If you want to increase/decrease RAM for a specific hub then please do use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=datahub-package-addition---change-request.md&title=Request+python+package+X+for+class+Y) to make the request.

**As an instructor, What is the process to create a hub for teaching a course?**

We generally prefer that you use our existing hubs for your work. You can use the Datahub for teaching purposes if you have a small class size and/or the computational requirements for your courses and/or research can be completed with existing RAM/CPU requirement. However, if you are interested to create a new hub then we would like to know the exact use case for creating a new hub.
