**What should I do if I want to install more packages?**

- Use your datahub instance to install the required version of the package. 

- Check if there are specific dependencies for this package and highlight them along with their version in your request. 

- Raise a request using this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=datahub-package-addition---change-request.md&title=Request+python+package+X+for+class+Y)!

**As an instructor, What should I do if I want to conduct a workshop? Are there any existing hubs that I could repurpose?**

Please send an email to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with the specific request you have in mind. We would like to know i) Your exact need, ii) Memory/CPU requirement, iii) Total number of participants, iv) Dataset size, and v) Language required.

**As a researcher, What is the process to request a hub focused on research?**

Please send an email to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with the specific request you have in mind. Use the pointers shared in the previous question.

**I am going to run a large dataset for my class. What are the steps I can take to ensure that the hub has the required compute power?**

As a rule of thumb, we recommend the following steps. If these steps are not helpful, then we would recommend reaching out to us separately,

**What should I do If I want to switch from an existing hub to an R hub?**

You can directly use the [R Datahub](http://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/) dedicated to serving courses using R. If you have other specific requirements, please do reach out to us.

**As an instructor, Can I request a custom image with different installation requirements?**

It depends on your requirement. Please do send an email to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with your detailed requirement.
