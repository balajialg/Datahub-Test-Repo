```{note}
Are you new to Datahub? Do you want to learn more about the services offered by the hub? If yes, Do refer below!

```

* What are the varied resources that I can review to onboard myself?

If you are new to Datahub and are interested to know more about the configuration used by various Berkeley organizations, you can refer to this [documentation](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/)

If you want to set up a hub infrastructure at your end and are interested to learn more about the technical details behind the set up then use this [documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* What programming languages are supported by the hub?

Datahub primarily supports three languages - Python, R and Julia. However, we can also support other languages on a case to case basis. Please do raise an github issue or send us an email to ds-infrastructure@lists.berkeley.edu to share your exact requirement.

* How many hubs across the campus exist? Which courses use them extensively?

Currently, We have 15+ hubs that caters to the diverse needs of our campus audience. This includes Datahub which is has the maximum number of courses/users. In addition, We have Data 8 hub, Data 100 hub, Biology hub etc.. serving the needs of teaching team and students enrolled as part of Data 8, Data 100 and Biology courses respectively.

You can learn more about the hubs deployed through this [link](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/users/hubs.html)

* What is the default Memory/CPU requirement for every hub?

By default our hubs offer 1 GB RAM. However, if your class/research requires more complex computation then please do reach out to us.

* What are the different services offered as part of the Datahub?

You can learn more about the varied services through this [documentation](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/users/services.html)

* What are the packages pre-installed for every hub?

Package requirement varies across every hub. We ensure that the basic packages such as Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn etc.. are installed across all the hubs

* What is the process to raise Github issues? How can I track the raised issues?

If you want to raise a bug currently, you can use this [link](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new/choose) to raise issues

You can also use post messages to our Piazza channel to raise further queries 

* When do I receive a response when an issue gets raised?

We currently don't have any kind of SLA with regards to requests from users. However, as a rule of thumb we try to respond to your queries within 1-2 days tie

We will resolve queries related to package installation and admin requests between 1-3 days time

* Are there existing templates for submitting requests to the infrastructure team?

There are multiple templates available which are summarized below,

i) **Issue Tracker:** If you found a bug in the workflow and want to raise an issue for the same, then please do use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) to raise an issue


ii) **New Enhancement:** If you found a new feature/documentation that would help you with the existing workflow then please do use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=featurerequest.md) to raise an issue


iii) **Package Addition/Change request:** If you want to install new packages in R/Python/Julia as part of your hub then please do raise a request using this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=higher-resources.md&title=Request+more+RAM+for+class+X)


iv) **Request for RAM:** If you want to increase/decrease RAM for your specific hub then please do use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=datahub-package-addition---change-request.md&title=Request+python+package+X+for+class+Y) to request

* As an instructor, What is the process to create a hub for teaching a course?

We would like to know the exact use case for creating a hub. We generally recommend using the Datahub for teaching purposes if it is a small class size or the computational requirements for your courses/research can be completed with.
