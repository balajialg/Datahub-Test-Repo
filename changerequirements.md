# Changing existing requirements

```{note}
Are you interested to learn more about how to change the default requirements for the Datahub? If yes, read below!

```

**What should I do if I want to increase the RAM size in my hub?**
Use this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=higher-resources.md&title=Request+more+RAM+for+class+X) to make a request. 
Please do highlight the reasons for requesting this upgrade. 

**What should I do if I need more CPU power as part of my hub?**

We would like to know the reasons for requesting more CPU power as it has cost implications at our end. Raise a request using this [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new/choose)! 

**What should I do if I want to install more packages?**

Please do use your datahub instance to install the required version of the package. Check if there are dependencies for this package and highlight those dependencies along with their version as part of your request. Raise a request using the [template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&template=datahub-package-addition---change-request.md&title=Request+python+package+X+for+class+Y)!

**As an instructor, What should I do if I want to conduct a workshop? Are there any existing hubs that I could repurpose?**

Please do send an email to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with the specific request you have in mind. We would like to know i) your detailed request, ii) memory requirement, iii) CPU requirement, iv) the total number of participants, v) Dataset size, and vi) Language required.

**As a researcher, What is the process to request a hub focused on research?**

Please do send an email to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu)  with the specific request you have in mind. Please do use the template shared in the previous question.

**I am going to run a large dataset for my class. What are the steps I can take to ensure that the hub has the required compute power?**

As a rule of thumb, we recommend the following steps. If these steps are not helpful, then we would recommend reaching out to us separately,

**What should I do If I want to switch from an existing hub to an R hub?**

You can directly use the [R Datahub](http://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/) dedicated to serving courses using R. If you have other specific requirements, please do reach out to us.

**As an instructor, Can I request a custom image with different installation requirements?**

It depends on your usecase. Please do send an email to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with your specific usecase.
