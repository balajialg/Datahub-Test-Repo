**As an instructor, What should I do if I want to conduct a workshop? Are there any existing hubs that I could repurpose?**

Send an email to Eric Van Dusen(ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar(balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with the specific use case you have in mind. We would like to know i) your detailed request, ii) memory requirement, iii) CPU requirement, iv) the total number of participants, v) Dataset size, and vi) Language required.

**As a researcher, What is the process to request a hub focused on research?**

Send an email to Eric Van Dusen(ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar(balajialwar@berkeley.edu)  with the specific usecase you have in mind. Please do follow the above template to make this request.

**I am going to run a large dataset for my class. What are the steps I can take to ensure that the hub has the required compute power?**

As a rule of thumb, we recommend the following steps. If these steps are not helpful, then we would recommend reaching out to us separately,
